## 🔍 Project description
For the class "Big-Scale Analytics", which is part of our Master's programm in Information Systems, we were giving the following challenge: we are creating a model for English speakers that predicts the difficulty of a French written text. (A1-C2)

--> "[...] as for how to use word frequencies for building readability prediction models, previous research typically employed mean frequencies or the percentage of words from the top frequency bands to characterize text levels."

--> "Yet, this loses a lot of information about the distribution of word frequencies in the text. Averaging is easily affected by extreme values, and it loses information about the variability of the data. Furthermore, averaging over all occurrences of words in a text will minimize the contribution of low-frequency words."
